# Hospital Patient Outcome & Resource Analysis

This project is built to explore how patient outcomes and hospital resources are connected. I created fake hospital data for patients, admissions, wards, diagnoses, and billing to simulate a real-world healthcare scenario.

The goal was to analyze recovery patterns, diagnosis severity, ward usage, and cost-related data using SQL, Python, and Excel â€” like how a data analyst would do in an actual hospital setup.

## What I did

- Created SQL tables and linked them properly with primary and foreign keys
- Used Python to generate realistic dummy data and do some EDA
- Exported everything to Excel and did final analysis using pivot charts

## Tools I used

- PostgreSQL + DBeaver (for database and table setup)
- Python with Pandas and Matplotlib (for loading + exploring the data)
- Excel (for pivot charts and final insights)
- Git + GitHub (to manage and upload the project)

## Insights I found (in Excel)

- Patient gender ratio and age comparison
- Which wards had longer recovery periods
- Severity levels of diagnoses (shown as a pie chart)
- Diagnosis distribution across categories

## What I learned

- How to create clean database schemas for real-world use cases
- How to think like an analyst and ask good questions about healthcare data
- How to use Excel to present insights in a clean and simple way
